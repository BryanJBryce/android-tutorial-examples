### Each project comes as an Android Studio 1.0 project. When opening a project for the first time: ###
### 1. If you see a message saying 'The path ... does not refer to an Android SDK. Android Studio will use its default SDK instead,' click OK. ###
### 2. If you see a message saying 'Failed to find Build Tools revision 21.1.2', open your build.gradle file and replace this line with the version in Android Studio (Check your build tools version in the SDK Manager) ###
###     buildToolsVersion "21.1.2" ###
### 3. If you see a message saying 'Failed to sync the Gradle project .... Fix plugin version and re-import project,' simply click the link to agree.  ###
### 4. If you see a warning that says 'Language level changes will take effect on project reload. Would you like to reload project ... now?', click Yes. ###
